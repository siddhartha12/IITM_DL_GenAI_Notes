    "1. As a feature Extractor\n",
    "    * The pre trained convolutional base is used as a fixed feature extractor\n",
    "    * We Freeze the weights of the base layers remove the original calssifier and add a new classifier\n",
    "    * Only the new classifier is trainer, idea for new dataset small\n",
    "2. as a fine-tuner\n",
    "    * Initialize the network with pre-trained weights just like before\n",
    "    * WE unfreeze either the entire network or the top few convolutional layers\n",
    "    * We continue training the whole model (or part) end to end on the new data using a very low learning rate\n",

    "## Transfer Learning for Segmentation\n",
    "for segmentation, transfer learning is used to build the encoder part of an encoder-decoder network\n",
    "(think of encoder-decoder like PCA, we encode values into a smaller set, then we can decode into the orginal values)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Using the pre trained model** -> entire encoder path is replaced with a pre-trained classification network, This is called the \"backbone\", this provides the rich semantic feature extraction learned from ImageNet\n",
    "* **Training the decoder** -> new decoder head is added, takes the powerful low resolution features from the encoder and progressively upsamples them to rebuild the high resolution pixel level segmentation mask "
