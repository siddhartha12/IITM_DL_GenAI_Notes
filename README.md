# Introduction to Deep Learning and Generative AI

Quiz 1: October 26 2025         Quiz 2: November 23 2025        End term:  December 21 2025

Above to be attended in person at designated centres

Eligibility to write End term exam:  Average of the first 5 weekly assessments scores >= 40/100 and attending at least one of the 2 quizzes in the centre

Eligibility to get the final course grade: Attending the end sem exam

The calculation of Final course score is proposed as follows:

- GAA = Average score in First 9 weekly graded assignments

- Qz1 = score in Quiz I (0, if not attempted)

- Qz2 = score in Quiz II (0, if not attempted)

- F = score in final exam

- Overall score for eligible students:

Weekly content will be shared by Friday as usual. Assignments will be released on the following Wednesday, with the submission deadline set for the next Wednesday.

T = 0.2 GAA +  0.15 Qz1 + 0.15 Qz2 + 0.2 F + 0.15 NPPE1 + 0.15 NPPE2
